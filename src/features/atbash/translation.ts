    'Atbash was probably invented by the Essenes, a Jewish rebels. They have developed a variety of codes and ciphers that have been used to conceal the important names and titles to avoid prosecution. Knowledge of codes and ciphers were then transferred to the Gnostics, who handed them over to Qatar. Later, the Knights Templar recruited Qatari nobles and adopt this knowledge. Thus, the code has been used for many years, from about 500 BC to 1300 AD - The moment when the Knights Templar was dissolved.',
